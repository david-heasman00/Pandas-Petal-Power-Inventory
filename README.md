# Pandas-Petal-Power-Inventory

Hi there. 

If you're viewing this, you're probably shopping around my portfolio. Maybe you're my future boss. Maybe you're a recruiter. Maybe you're a future client. Or maybe you're just a curious person. 

Whatever the case, it's lovely to meet you. 

## What is this?

Being a Data Journalist is part writer, part data visualiser, and part data-jack-of-all-trades. As part of my eagerness to tell better stories, and to carry out better data analysis (and keep my career options open), I've been going through the [Codecademy Data Scientist (Machine Learning) Skill Path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/data-science) 

(I've completed the SQL part. You can view my certificate [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Legrq2X0gKU4fsR8XU_1eY_9k3Ftid8g/view?usp=drive_link)). 

This project was part of the Python Pandas for Data Science Module (which was part of the Data Science Foundations II section â€“ it's a big course). 

It's at the end of the "Hands on with Pandas" chapter, and is intended to provide some practice on reading and modifying dataframes in Pandas. 

## What did you learn?

* How to modify columns and rows in Pandas
* How to use lamdba functions 
* How to use boolean indexing

## Where can I view the code?

**[You can see my jupyter notebook solution here.](https://nbviewer.org/github/david-heasman00/Pandas-Petal-Power-Inventory/blob/main/Petal%20Power%20Inventory.ipynb)**

## How can I speak to you?

Want to chat about a project, or a potential opportunity? I'm happy to connect [on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidheasman/). Include a brief note in your connection request about why you're reaching out. 

Till later.
